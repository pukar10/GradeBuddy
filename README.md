# GradeBuddySwing
GradeBuddy accepts input to calculate course grade. Use your syllabus to input categories such as HW, Quizzes, Tests. Input category 
worth, then input your grades for the categories. Final grade will be calculated. 

## Approach
Use java swing to create an application that accepts grade input and outputs final grade. We used java swing to implement our GUI. Arrays and linked lists to store data and threading to handle visuals and computation.
